# SwiftModuleGenerator
Swift Apple app Module Generator according to architectures we use

swiftui https://github.com/techpro-studio/SwiftUIAppArchitecture

uikit https://github.com/techpro-studio/iOSAppArchitecture

You can clone this repo, and run build.sh.

After be sure that /usr/local/bin has been added to bash PATH.

So, now you can use it by calling
